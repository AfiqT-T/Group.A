## Challenges 
1. Connecting, seeding and migrating database.
2. Figure out route that should be taken by a certain pages.
3. Authentication. To change the route with the middleware auth sanctum.
4. Creating fake data using factories are  confusing as each model, controller, migration file and view files must be sync perfectly.
5. Creating a form that can be filled out, submitted, and viewed afterward.
